		Welcome in the stage editor.


--------------------------------------
	WARNINGS
	
First keep in mind that :
 1 - Although the best efforts are made to offer you a view that match the one made by OpenBOR, there could be some differences.
 2 - This is only a tool for moding, and there is no garantee that there will be no errors when launching OpenBOR (example : the panels must have the same width, if not, although the editor will not prompt you, OpenBOR will crash).
 
 So, you have to read the doc (http://lavalit.com)
