How to create a palette in 8bit mode :

A - Click "New" and give a name, if you want.

B - Specifify the base image and the Result image
OpenBOR will deduce the remapping by comparing these two images.
 
C - Do the remapping
You have to manually reassign each color from the original image to a new off THE SAME PALETTE.
To make a reassignement you must :
1 - select a color in the palette
	For this 2 way:
		a - With the mouse just click on a color in the palette.
		b - On the image view on the right panel, pick a color with your mouse.
2 - reassign the palette color :
	Two ways also :
		a - With the mouse, click on a color in the palette with ALT or SHIFT pressed 
		a - With the mouse, pick a color in the imatge on the right panel with ALT or SHIFT pressed

You can see reassignement : the originated palette color is surrounded with blue, and the reassignement with green.
 
Once you've done you have to click SAVE. The obeditor will create/overwrite the resulted image with your remap.
